# Bibliophilia: What bookworms Need to know.
This personal blog has been created to share my experience and thoughts about literature books that I have read. You will find below a list of novels with cliffhanger storylines.
## **Some English books:**
- The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins.  
- Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley
- Inferno, by Dan Brown
### You can find a summary of the plots in [Sparknotes](https://www.sparknotes.com/), a website that I usually consult before buying a new book:
- [The Hunger Games](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/the-hunger-games/summary/)
- [Frankenstein](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/frankenstein/summary/)
- [Inferno](https://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/inferno/summary/)
